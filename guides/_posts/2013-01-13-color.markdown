- [`fill()`](http://processing.org/reference/fill_.html) and
  [`noFill()`](http://processing.org/reference/noFill_.html)

## On test 1

You will see questions like the following:

- what is the code to set the fill color to white/black/very-light-gray?
- what is the code to set the fill color 50% transparent dark red?
- what is the code to set the background color to bright
  yellow/purple/cyan? (the three simplest combinations of two colors)

Some of these questions have a range of valid answers since, e.g.,
"dark red" is open to some interpretation.

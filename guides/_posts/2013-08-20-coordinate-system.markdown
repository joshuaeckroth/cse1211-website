## Important functions and variables

- [`size()`](http://processing.org/reference/size_.html)
- [`width`](http://processing.org/reference/width.html) and
  [`height`](http://processing.org/reference/height.html) variables
- [`point()`](http://processing.org/reference/point_.html)
- [`rect()`](http://processing.org/reference/rect_.html)
- [`ellipse()`](http://processing.org/reference/ellipse_.html)
- [`triangle()`](http://processing.org/reference/triangle_.html)
- [`arc()`](http://processing.org/reference/arc_.html)
- [`rectMode()`](http://processing.org/reference/rectMode_.html)
- [`ellipseMode()`](http://processing.org/reference/ellipseMode_.html)

## What you'll need to know for test 1

- How to draw various shapes in specific locations (given by pixel
  coordinates) and "relative" locations, e.g., "middle of the window"
  (use `width/2` and `height/2` for the middle of the window).
  
- How to draw an arc from specific start and stop radians.

- The differences among `rectMode(CENTER)`, `rectMode(CORNERS)`,
  `rectMode(RADIUS)`, and the same for `ellipseMode`.

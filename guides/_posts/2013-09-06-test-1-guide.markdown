# Test 1 Guide

You will see some questions like the following. The test is on paper,
closed-notes. The material covered is the coordinate system, colors,
animation, and variables and types. Refer to the corresponding videos
for those topics.

## Coordinate system and shapes

- what is the code to draw a 4x4 square in the middle of a 50x50 window?
- what is the code to draw a 4x4 square in the middle of a window of any size?
- what is the code to draw an ellipse that touches the four edges of a window of any size?
- what is the code to draw a rectangle that covers the entire window (and no more)?
- draw the shape of an arc from 0 to PI/2 (I don't want code, I want the actual shape)

## Color

- what is the code to set the fill color to white or black or very-light-gray?
- what is the code to set the fill color to 50% transparent dark red?
- what is the code to set the background color to bright yellow or
  purple or cyan? (the three simplest combinations of two colors)

Some of these questions have a range of valid answers since, e.g.,
"dark red" is open to some interpretation.

## Variables and types

- what type should be used to hold the value 55 (not 55.0)?
- what type should be used to hold the value 55.5?
- what type should be used to hold the value "foo bar"
- what type should be used to hold the value of a single symbol that can be typed on the keyboard?
- what type should be used to hold the value true or false?

What is the result of each of the following computations?

{% highlight java %}
55 % 10
55 / 10
2.4 / 2.0
pow(2.0, 2.0)
{% endhighlight %}

If we have `int x = 5`, what is the value of `x` after each of these commands:

{% highlight java %}
x--;
x--;
x *= 2;
x++;
{% endhighlight %}

If we have `boolean q = true`, what is the value of `q` after each of these commands:

{% highlight java %}
q = false;
q = true || q;
q = !q;
{% endhighlight %}

## Animation

Write the chunk of code (two functions) we will always include when we
start writing a program.

Identify which of the two following chunks of code properly moves a
triangle from the left of the screen to the right.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
{% highlight java %}
int x = 0;
int y = 200;

void setup()
{
    size(400, 400);
}

void draw()
{
    x--;
    background(0);
    triangle(x-50, y+50, x, y, x+50, y+50);
}
{% endhighlight %}
</td>
<td>
{% highlight java %}
int x = 0;
int y = 200;

void setup()
{
    size(400, 400);
}

void draw()
{
    background(0);
    triangle(x-50, y+50, x, y, x+50, y+50);
    x = x + 5;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Complete this code so that the ellipse starts large but shrinks over
time (its size is allowed to become negative).

{% highlight java %}
int ________________;

void ________________
{
    size(400, 400);
}

void ________________
{
    background(255);
    ellipse(50, 100, ________________);
    
    __________________________;
}
{% endhighlight %}

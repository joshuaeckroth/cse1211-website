# Test 3 Guide

You will see some questions like the following. The test is on paper,
closed-notes.

## 2D transformations

Assume you have this code:

{% highlight java %}
void setup()
{
  size(500, 500);
  noLoop();
  rectMode(CENTER);
}

void draw()
{
  background(255);
  fill(0);
  
  pushMatrix();
  
  // ...

  rect(0, 0, 20, 100);
  
  // ...
  
  popMatrix();
}
{% endhighlight %}


Replace `// ...` with the appropriate combinations of `pushMatrix()`,
`popMatrix()`, `scale()`, `rotate()`, and `translate()` in order to
produce the following displays. You are not allowed to use any shape
functions except the exact `rect(0, 0, 20, 100)` provided. Assume the
large white rectangle with the black border is the whole 500x500
window. In some cases, `// ...` may not need to be replaced with code
and may be left blank.

For the next two cases, use this template in `draw()`:

{% highlight java %}
background(255);
fill(0);

pushMatrix();
  
// ...

for (......)
{
  // ...
  
  rect(0, 0, 20, 100);
  
  // ...
}

// ...

popMatrix();
{% endhighlight %}

## Object-oriented programming

If you see this code, `Xyz abc;` you can safely assume (in this class)
that we are using object-oriented programming. Which of `Xyz` and
`abc` is the class? Which is the object? What's a good synonym for
"class" (in our usage)? What's a good synonym for "object"?

Here is a class:

{% highlight java %}
class Foo
{
  Foo()
  {
    println("A");
  }
  
  void f1()
  {
    println("B");
  }
  
  void f2()
  {
    println("C");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which message, if any, is printed when we do this: `Foo myfoo;` And
what about this: `myfoo = new Foo();` And finally, what about this:
`myfoo.f2();`

Which function is the constructor? Which message does the constructor
print?

Write the code necessary to declare and initialize an array of 200
`Foo` objects (instances).

Suppose we have this code:

{% highlight java %}
Baz b = new Baz("Claudia");
b.printMany(5); // prints "Claudia" five times, on separate lines
b.printMany(12); // prints "Claudia" twelve times, on separate lines
Baz c = new Baz("James");
c.printMany(3); // prints "James" three times, on separate lines
{% endhighlight %}

Write a class that enables the code above to work as described. You
must define this class with exactly seven lines of code, the minimum
possible (as far as I know). We count lines of code by ignoring blank
lines and lines with only `{` or `}`, and using the normal coding
style we have seen in this class.

When we are using objects, what is the most common cause of a
"NullPointerException"?

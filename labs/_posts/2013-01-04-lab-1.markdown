# Lab 1

We'll be programming with the tool known as Processing.

Your task in this lab is to figure out how to install Processing and
create a "sketch" (their word for a "program") that draws a circle.

Create an "archive" of your sketch (this creates a ZIP file) and put
it in the Carmen dropbox. You can create an archive by using the Tools
menu in Processing.

This lab description is intentionally vague.

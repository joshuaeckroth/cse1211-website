# Lab 2

Read about the coordinate system and colors. Draw an object, e.g. a
person, a monkey, a car, a rocket, etc. Don't draw the same thing as
anyone else or any online guide.

The drawing must be recognizable. Use appropriate colors. You can be
artistic, but convince me you know what you're doing, and not just
putting random shapes and random colors on the screen.

You are required to have:

- at least one use of alpha transparency in a color
- at least one use of `ellipse()`
- at least one use of `triangle()`
- at least one use of `arc()`
- at least one use of `curve()`
- at least one use of `background()`
- at least one use of `fill()`
- at least one use of `noFill()`
- at least one use of `stroke()`
- at least one use of `noStroke()`

If you want an extra challenge, try:

- creating 3D shapes, e.g. `box()` and `sphere()`
- creating polygons with `beginShape()`, multiple uses of `vertex()`,
  and `endShape()`

# Lab 4

Watch the video about
[keyboard input](/videos/2013-01-26-video-keyboard-input-1.html).

Create a keyboard-controlled program. At least one object has to move
based on keyboard input. Or, at least one object may appear or
disappear, or change colors, based on keyboard input. Make at least
four different kinds of responses, depending on which keys are
pressed. You must check basic keys like `key == 'w'` and key codes
like `keyCode == UP`.

There is a big list of key codes at the
[Java reference page](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html). Each
item in that list starts `VK_`; just remove the `VK_` and you have the
keycode. You may also find the Processing references useful:
[keyPressed()](http://processing.org/reference/keyPressed_.html),
[key](http://processing.org/reference/key.html), and
[keyCode](http://processing.org/reference/keyCode.html).

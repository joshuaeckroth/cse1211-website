# Lab 5

Watch the [video about mouse input](/videos/2013-02-04-mouse-input-1.html).

Create a program that responds to mouse movements and clicks. A
response could be something moves, changes colors, etc.

You are required to have:

- at least one response to a mouse movement
- at least one response to a mouse click or mouse drag
- use of each of `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `pmouseX`, and `pmouseY` variables
- use of one (or more) of `mouseClicked()` or `mouseDragged()` or
  `mousePressed()` or `mouseReleased()` functions
  
At the top of your program in a comment, you are required to explain
what your program does. For example,

{% highlight java %}
// This program changes the background color depending on how fast you
// move the mouse (using mouseX-pmouseX and mouseY-pmouseY to get
// velocity), and changes the colors of two boxes when you click inside
// them.

void setup()
{
  ...
}

void draw()
{
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

  
You will lose points if you create a program that seems without design
or purpose. You will receive virtually no points if you only copy what
I do in videos.

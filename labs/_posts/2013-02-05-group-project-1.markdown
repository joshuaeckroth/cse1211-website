# Group project 1

Watch the videos about
[game design 1](/videos/2013-02-05-game-design-1.html) and
[game design 2](/videos/2013-02-05-game-design-2.html).

You are required to work in a group of two people. If you already have
a partner in mind, that's fine, work with that person. On Monday
(02/11) we'll find partners for people who do not yet have one. You
will both receive the same grade. You are required to make a simple
game, with the following elements:

- a goal
- keyboard and/or mouse control
- score (shown on the screen)
- difficulty levels
- a way to lose
- at least somewhat visually appealing

Finally, when you turn in the code, either in a dropbox comment or
comment in the code, specify which person was responsible for which
features. Both people should contribute equally. If there is a big
disparity in contributions, your grades will not be equal.

Only one person needs to submit the code in the dropbox.

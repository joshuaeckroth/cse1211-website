# Lab 6

Watch the videos about arrays:
[arrays 1](/videos/2013-02-18-arrays-1.html),
[arrays 2](/videos/2013-02-18-arrays-2.html),
[array utilities](/videos/2013-02-23-array-utilities.html), and
[`for` loops](/videos/2013-02-20-for-loops.html).

Create a program that uses arrays and `for` loops.

You are required to have:

- at least two arrays
- at least two `for` loops: one in `setup()` and one in `draw()`; you
  can have more, of course
- at least some of the values in some of the arrays must change over
  time
  
At the top of your program in a comment, you are required to explain
what your program does.

Ideas:

- show a row or grid of color-changing or size-changing squares or
  other shapes

- shoot lines across the screen from several directions

- show "explosions" or "guns" where many dots suddenly move away from
  a central location
  
- allow the user to click different locations to activate glowing
  balls or whatever at those locations
  
- allow the user to drag shapes around the screen, as if assembling a
  jigsaw puzzle
  
You will lose points if you create a program that seems without design
or purpose. You will receive virtually no points if you only copy what
I do in videos.

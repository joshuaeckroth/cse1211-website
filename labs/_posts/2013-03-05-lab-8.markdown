# Lab 8

Read about [images](/guides/2013-03-05-images.html). Modify your lab
5, lab 6, or lab 7 code so that you load and draw images instead of
shapes. Use any images you want (but keep them "tasteful").

You are required to display at least three different images. You are
also required to have keyboard and/or mouse control in some manner.

You are not required to use arrays, but it would be good practice for
you to have an array of images...

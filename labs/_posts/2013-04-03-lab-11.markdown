# Lab 11

Read about [physics simulations](/guides/2013-03-31-physics.html) and
watch the [lecture video about fisica](/videos/2013-04-03-fisica-lecture.html) and the
[video about Angry Birds](/videos/2013-04-03-fisica-angry-birds.html). Refer
to the
[fisica manual](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/reference/index.html)
and the
[Processing Wiki](http://wiki.processing.org/w/Fisica_/_JBox2D_physics_engine).

Create a car drivetrain simulation. You'll need two wheels
(FCircle's), two bearings in the middle of the wheels (FCircle's, and
which need to be "sensors" so they don't have bizarre interactions
with the wheels), an FDistanceJoint keeping the bearings connected via
a shaft, and two axels (FRevoluteJoint's) that connect the bearings to
the wheels. These axels have internal "motors." If you know anything
about cars, and your head is spinning due to a misuse of terms, I
apologize!

You'll need to look carefully at the
[fisica manual](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/fisica/reference/index.html)
to figure out how to use these classes (FDistanceJoint,
FRevoluteJoint, etc.). Several of the functions you need are not well
documented. Such is life as a programmer. Some hints: don't forget to
set some friction on the wheels, enable a "max torque" on the axels,
enable the motor on the axels, and set the motor speed on the axels.

Use the FPoly "floor" from the
[physics simulation notes](http://cse1211.artifice.cc/guides/2013-03-31-physics.html),
the example called "A slanted floor, with friction."

Here is a demo of the drivetrain:

Here is another demo, with only the front-wheel axel having a motor
(i.e., front-wheel drive):

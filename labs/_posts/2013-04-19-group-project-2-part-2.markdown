# Group project 2, part 2

This page is copied from the
[part 1](/labs/2013-04-07-group-project-2-part-1.html) description.

## Requirements for the game

Your final game should be the culmination of all that you have learned
in this class. There is one exception: you are not required to use
fisica.

Your code is required to include:

- At least two classes in addition to your main file.

- At least one use each of `pushMatrix()` and `popMatrix()`, and at
  least one use of either (or all of) `scale()`, `rotate()`, and
  `translate()`.
  
- At least one use of `PImage` and `loadImage()`.

- At least one use of an array. (2D arrays are not necessary.)

- Mouse input or keyboard input (or both).

Additionally, you are required to have:

- An attractive background image or design.

- An opening screen that gives instructions for how to play.

- At least three levels of difficulty. The player(s) may or may not be
  allowed to choose the difficulty level.

- A way to restart after losing.

- A high score list. Allow the player with the high score to enter a
  name or initials. This list does not have to be saved to a file, it
  is ok if it is "forgotten" when the user quits the game.

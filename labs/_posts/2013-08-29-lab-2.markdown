# Lab 2


Watch the videos [animation
1](/videos/2013-08-29-video-animation-1.html) and [animation
2](/videos/2013-08-29-video-animation-2.html) (ignore the incorrect
dates about Lab 2, which is called Lab 3 in the video).

Create an interesting animation. Examples include,

- shapes with colors that gradually change over time
- rain drops on a window (random sizes, random positions, not always
  perfect circles)
- shapes that spiral towards the middle like a drain (requires use of
  `rotate()`)
- weird line patterns or something like glitch art

You are required to have:

- at least two variables to represent positions, or sizes, or colors, etc.
- changing variable values in the `draw()` function
- at least two kinds of shapes or lines/curves
- colors

Do not simply copy what I have done in the videos. You will lose
points if you do this. Instead, create a unique program that animates
objects in a different way. Your program doesn't have to be "clever"
or "creative" but it does have to be different.

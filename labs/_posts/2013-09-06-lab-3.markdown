# Lab 3

Watch the videos about [keyboard
input](/videos/2013-09-06-video-keyboard-input-1.html) and [mouse
input](/videos/2013-09-06-mouse-input-1.html).

Create a keyboard- and mouse-controlled program. At least one object
has to move based on keyboard input and/or mouse input. Or, at least
one object may appear or disappear, or change colors, based on
keyboard input and/or mouse input. Make at least four different kinds
of responses, depending on which keys are pressed and how the mouse is
moved. You must check basic keys like `key == 'w'` and key codes like
`keyCode == UP`. Regardless of how you do it, you are required to have
keyboard- and mouse-controlled features, even if it's just the same
object controlled by both the keyboard and mouse.

There is a big list of key codes at the [Java reference
page](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html). Each
item in that list starts `VK_`; just remove the `VK_` and you have the
keycode. You may also find the Processing references useful; refer to
the subsections "Mouse" and "Keyboard" under the "Input" section.
